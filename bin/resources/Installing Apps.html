	<h1>Installing Apps</h1>
	</br>
	<p>It is possible to modify any App in the main window through the "Edit" button".</p>
	<p>In the "Edit" menu it is possible to choose a .jar file that will be launch in order to start the App. This file should be previously placed in the folder "bin/Apps/NombrePrograma/Programa.jar".</p>
	<p>It is also possible to set any image of the supported types as the App icon. Its location doesn't matter, a copy of it will be made.</p>
	<p>Finally, it is possible to change the App number and to restore all App settings to the default ones (No App).</p>
	<p>In case of problems, or if wanting to modify any of these elements manually, it can be done through the appropriate line in the file "settings.conf".</p>
