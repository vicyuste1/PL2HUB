	<p>The program HUB has been thought to be a program that could hold the different exercise-resolving Apps for the subject "Programadores del lenguaje 2". Although it should be compatible with any Java App.</p>
	<p>The main window "Apps" allows to launch and configure up to 6 different Apps. The lateral menu bar contains the help and settings menus, as well as a button to close the program.</p>
	<p>Through the "Settings" button it is possible to change different program parameters. Currently it is only possible to change the language between English and Spanish.</p>
	<p>If an invalid path is used for the App or image, or if it is changed later on from the outside, it's possible that the HUB will not be able to start.</p>
	<p>If this happends, or in case of a different problem, it is possible to manually change the file "settings.conf" or restore it to its default version using the file "reset_settings.bat", in the main HUB program folder.</p>
